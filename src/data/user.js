		description:
			"I am a backend developer with expertise in NodeJS, Python, and C++. I also have expertise in frontend (e.g., React, Javascript, etc.) and working with data using data programming languages (e.g., R and SQL). Some of the projects using these languages can be seen on this site and in my Github. Additionally, I love experimenting in different fields, with the most recent field I dove being a legal field (IP Law). Some of the patents I helped draft are attached to this site. I enjoy solving complex problems and learning new skills. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.",
